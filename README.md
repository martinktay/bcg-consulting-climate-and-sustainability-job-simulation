# BCG Climate and Sustainability Job Simulation

I recently participated in BCG's job simulation on the Forage platform, gaining valuable insights into what it's like to be part of BCG's Climate & Sustainability team. 

I worked on a project focused on completing a carbon emissions analysis and analysing reduction initiatives to advise a company on the best course to reach Net Zero, whilst also making adaptations based on investor concerns. I practiced using industry-relevant tools and built my analytical skills in a real-world context. 

This experience confirmed my passion for addressing sustainability challenges, and I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills to BCG's Climate & Sustainability team to contribute to meaningful solutions.
